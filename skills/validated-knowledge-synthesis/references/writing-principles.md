## Reader Empathy

Empathy for the reader is paramount. Put yourself in the reader's shoes and simulate their thought process.

### Requirements
1. Clear understanding of who the reader is
2. Precise grasp of what is being asked of them

### Core Tenet
"Learning how to communicate something in 30 seconds that takes most people 5 minutes is a HUGE unlock."

### Practice Technique
If unsure, ask a friend to listen to you say something and then rephrase it back to you as concisely as they can. Repeat a few dozen times.

### Application
- Ground the reader from the outset
- Communicate key ideas in as few words as possible
- Ensure reader can immediately understand what is most critical
- Make clear what is being asked of them

## Short Sentences Principle

Short sentences are free. Long, complex sentences are costly.

### Mental Model
- Simple sentences build a reservoir of reader patience
- Spend that patience on complex concepts when necessary
- Make as many sentences simple as possible

### Guidelines
| Sentence Type | Cost | Usage |
|---------------|------|-------|
| Short, simple | Free | Use liberally |
| Medium, clear | Low | Use for explanations |
| Long, complex | High | Reserve for unavoidable complexity |

### Technique
- Break compound sentences into multiple simple ones
- One idea per sentence when possible
- Use periods instead of semicolons
- Avoid nested clauses

## Strong Verbs

Use precise, concrete verbs that get straight to the point.

### Avoid These Patterns

**Helper verbs** (has, had, have):
- Bad: "The system has completed the process"
- Good: "The system completed the process"

**Infinitive form** when direct verb works:
- Bad: "The goal is to prevent errors"
- Good: "Prevent errors"

**"To be" variations** (there are, it was):
- Bad: "There are three options available"
- Good: "Three options exist"

**Adverbs** (replace with strong verbs and specific details):
- Bad: "Move quickly"
- Good: "Sprint" or "Move within 2 seconds"

### Strong Verb Examples
| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| make a decision | decide |
| give consideration to | consider |
| conduct an investigation | investigate |
| perform an analysis | analyze |
| provide assistance | help |
| take action | act |

## Simple Words

Choose simpler words over complex ones. Simple doesn't mean short—it means the best, most precise word.

### Word Substitutions
| Complex | Simple |
|---------|--------|
| utilize | use |
| facilitate | help |
| commence | start |
| terminate | end |
| implement | do, make |
| leverage | use |
| functionality | features |
| methodology | method |
| subsequently | then |
| approximately | about |
| demonstrate | show |
| indicate | show |

### When to Use Complex Words
- When the complex word is more precise
- When the audience expects technical terminology
- When simpler alternatives change the meaning

### Translation Consideration
Simple words translate better. If content may be translated, prioritize clarity.

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any document, verify:

### Reader Empathy Check
- [ ] Reader identity is clear
- [ ] What's being asked is explicit
- [ ] Key ideas communicated in minimal words
- [ ] Reader grounded from the outset

### Sentence Check
- [ ] Complex sentences are necessary, not habitual
- [ ] One idea per sentence where possible
- [ ] Nested clauses minimized

### Verb Check
- [ ] Helper verbs eliminated where possible
- [ ] Direct verbs replace infinitives
- [ ] "To be" variations reduced
- [ ] Adverbs replaced with specifics

### Word Check
- [ ] Simple words used when equally precise
- [ ] Technical terms justified by precision need
- [ ] Translation-friendly where applicable

### Core Tenet Validation
Can this be communicated in 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes? If not, revise.
