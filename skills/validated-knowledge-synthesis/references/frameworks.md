## Golden Path Criteria

Five criteria for validating document quality.

### 1. Purpose & Audience
- State reason for document's existence
- Orient reader to key problem and objective
- Tailor tone, content, and detail to intended reader

**Validation Questions:**
- Is the document's purpose stated in the first paragraph?
- Would the intended reader find the tone appropriate?
- Is the level of detail right for the audience?

### 2. Clear & Concise
- Logical structure
- Easy to understand
- Free of unnecessary words
- Clear connections between ideas
- Maintain brevity

**Validation Questions:**
- Can any words be removed without losing meaning?
- Does each sentence earn its place?
- Are connections between ideas explicit?

### 3. Structure & Logic
- Methodical structure
- Logically stacks ideas and arguments
- Supports final proposal or conclusion

**Validation Questions:**
- Does each section build on the previous?
- Does the structure lead naturally to the conclusion?
- Would reordering sections improve the logic?

### 4. Evidence & Impact
- Substantiate benefits with evidence
- Show cost of inaction
- Evaluate alternatives with trade-offs
- Demonstrate foresight

**Validation Questions:**
- Is each claim supported by evidence?
- Are alternatives acknowledged and addressed?
- Is the cost of not acting clear?

### 5. Action & Execution
- Make specific needs clear
- Define next steps
- Assign owners
- Proposal can be executed immediately

**Validation Questions:**
- Can the reader act on this immediately?
- Are next steps specific and assigned?
- Is anything blocking execution?

## Answer-Explain-Educate Framework

Structure for responding to questions or presenting information.

### Structure

**Answer** (1-2 sentences)
Lead with short, direct response: yes/no/number/date/key finding.

**Explain** (1-3 sentences)
Support or expand the answer with key details. Provide the "why" behind the answer.

**Educate** (as needed)
Add context important for the reader. Background, implications, related considerations.

### Example Application

*Question: Should we migrate to the new API?*

**Answer:** Yes, migrate by Q2.

**Explain:** The current API reaches end-of-life in June. Migration now avoids emergency work later and gives buffer for issues.

**Educate:** The new API also offers rate limit improvements that will help with our scaling plans. Three teams completed migration last quarter with no major issues.

### When to Use
- Responding to direct questions
- Executive summaries
- Status updates
- Decision documents
- Any communication where the reader wants the bottom line first

## What-So What-Now What Framework

Structure for analysis and recommendations.

### Structure

**What** (Facts)
Present facts and key details of the situation. Objective, verifiable information.

**So What** (Analysis)
YOUR analysis of these facts and their consequences for the audience. Interpretation and implications.

**Now What** (Recommendation)
YOUR proposed recommendation, action, or decision based on your analysis.

### Example Application

*Topic: Q3 user growth metrics*

**What:** Active users grew 12% in Q3, but engagement time dropped 8%. New user acquisition exceeded targets by 15%.

**So What:** Growth is healthy but shallow. Users are signing up but not finding long-term value. If this pattern continues, churn will increase in Q4.

**Now What:** Prioritize onboarding improvements over acquisition spend. Run user research to identify friction points in the first-week experience.

### When to Use
- Analysis documents
- Situation reports
- Problem-solution narratives
- Post-mortems
- Strategic recommendations

## Framework Selection Guide

| Scenario | Framework |
|----------|-----------|
| Answering a direct question | Answer-Explain-Educate |
| Presenting analysis with recommendation | What-So What-Now What |
| Validating document quality | Golden Path Criteria |
| Executive communication | Answer-Explain-Educate |
| Strategic planning | What-So What-Now What |
| Technical documentation | Golden Path Criteria (validation) |

### Combining Frameworks

Frameworks can be layered:

1. Use **What-So What-Now What** for document structure
2. Apply **Answer-Explain-Educate** within each section
3. Validate entire document against **Golden Path Criteria**

### Example Combined Structure
```markdown
## Executive Summary
[Answer-Explain-Educate: Key finding, supporting detail, context]

## Situation Analysis
### What: Current State
[Facts and details]

### So What: Implications
[Analysis using Answer-Explain-Educate for each point]

### Now What: Recommendations
[Actions using Answer-Explain-Educate for each recommendation]

[Validate entire document against Golden Path Criteria]
```
